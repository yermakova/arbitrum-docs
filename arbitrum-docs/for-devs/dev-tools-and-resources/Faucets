## Faucets

A testnet faucet is a faucet that provides free testnet tokens. Testnet tokens are non-monetary versions of mainnet tokens that are used for testing purposes on a testnet blockchain. 

Below you can find faucets for obtaining testnet ETH:

### Sepolia 
Ethereum Sepolia is a public testnet for Ethereum. It is used to test and develop Ethereum applications before they are deployed to mainnet.

Sepolia is designed to be compatible with the Ethereum Merge. Sepolia also has a permissioned validator set, which means that it is run by a limited number of trusted validators. 

### Goerli & Rinkeby
Goerli and Rinkeby have been [deprecated](https://github.com/eth-clients/goerli) and will soon lose all support. Official guidance is to use Sepolia. Goerli and Rinkeby faucets are not listed in the table for this reason.
